client server is running on localhost:3000;
and server is running on localhost:4000;


I used mongodb for database;

admin login = {

username:pksumitkumar98@gmail.com,
password:12


}

To create new admin  just go to ' http://localhost:3000/registeradmin ' route;


To run server and client both simultaneously , so just run commands in capgemini_task folder =  yarn start or npm start;


sometimes  you may face network  error , so don't  worry , just restart a server it occur due  to authentication expired or not find auth user after given exam or quiz .
